### Paper Contributions

IncidentNet presents two main contributions, to address the challenge of detecting incidents between intersections:

1. A repeatable approach for generating realistic fine-grain synthetic datasets using traffic flow data within a microscopic traffic simulator, facilitating researchers with more realistic data. Our method takes readily available coarse-grain public traffic flow data. It generates a synthetic dataset using traffic data within a simulator that closely matches the coarse-grain distributions of the public traffic flow real-world dataset.
2. A novel technique that can detect and localize a traffic incident without the incident being directly in the field of view of a visual sensor. Localization of the incident is achievable without knowing the precise distance between sensors. This incident detection technique is also robust to sparse sensor placement in urban regions.
